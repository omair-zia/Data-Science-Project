Project Overview:
The goal of the Hotel Reservations Cancellation Prediction project is to anticipate potential reservation cancellations by analyzing various features and variables associated with hotel bookings. In the context of the project, online hotel reservation channels have revolutionized booking methods and customer behavior. However, a significant number of reservations are canceled, leading to revenue loss for hotels. Cancellations occur for reasons such as changes in plans or scheduling conflicts, often facilitated by the option of free or low-cost cancellations. This project seeks to predict such cancellations based on available data.
